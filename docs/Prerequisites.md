# Prerequisites
Fellow developers or those who are just curious surly want to know what is needed to compile the presented project on their own machines.  This is what I used:

# Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise (Professional will suffice)
# The result of the VSPackage Builder (add-in sadly only available for VS2010)

**{"Before V1.3 R7 (18) [2015-08-07](2015-08-07)"}**
# Visual Studio 2010 Premium (Professional will suffice)
# [VSPackage Builder](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e9f40a57-3c9a-4d61-b3ec-1640c59549b3) which makes extension building more comfortable
# [Visual Studio 2010 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=47305cf4-2bea-43c0-91cd-1b853602dcc5&displaylang=en) as prerequisite for VSPackage Builder
